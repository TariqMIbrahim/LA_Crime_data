# Los Angeles Crime Dataset Analysis

This project is a comprehensive analysis of the Los Angeles Crime Dataset. The notebook processes, analyzes, and visualizes crime data to uncover trends, correlations, and insights that can assist in informed decision-making.

## Overview
The dataset contains detailed information about crimes reported in Los Angeles, including:
- Date and time of occurrence
- Crime category
- Location (latitude and longitude)
- Reporting district

This project focuses on exploring patterns in the data, such as:
- Crime frequency by category
- Trends over time
- Geographical distribution of crimes

## Objectives
- Clean and preprocess the dataset for analysis.
- Generate visualizations to identify crime patterns.
- Provide actionable insights based on the data.

## Features
- **Data Cleaning**: Handles missing values and ensures data consistency.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Summarizes key statistics and visual trends.
- **Visualizations**: Includes bar charts, line graphs, and geographical heatmaps.
- **Geospatial Analysis**: Identifies hotspots for different crime categories.

## Key Libraries Used
- **pandas**: For data manipulation and cleaning.
- **matplotlib & seaborn**: For data visualization.
- **geopandas & folium**: For geospatial mapping.

## How to Use
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash

4. Run the cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis.

## Insights
- Certain areas exhibit a higher frequency of crimes, indicating potential hotspots.
- Specific times of day and days of the week show increased criminal activity.
- Crimes like burglary and theft are more prevalent in specific districts.

## Visualizations
